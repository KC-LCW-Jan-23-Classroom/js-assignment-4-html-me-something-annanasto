          The shoebill is a large, carnivorous, prehistoric-looking bird found
          in East African freshwater swamps. Their name comes from their
          oversized beaks that resemble a Dutch clog. The rest of their body is
          also really strange&mdash;with long legs like an ostrich and a body
          like a stork. Their diet mainly consists of fish, but they've also
          been known to eat small snakes, frogs, and baby crocodiles.

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Shoebills make excellent parents! The female lays 1 to 3 eggs but they
          rarely raise more than one chick. The younger chicks are usually left
          to die and are only kept as "back-ups" in case the eldest chick
          doesn't make it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shoebills are known to be docile with humans. They tend to just greet
          people with long and unblinking death glares.

        <p>
          Sloth bears inhabit a variety of habitats across the Indian
          subcontinent. They have shaggy fur, a main around their face, and
          3-inch claws. Sloth bears are usually active and in search of food.
          They mainly eat bugs and termites but will also eat fruits and honey
          when available.

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Sloth bears are unpredictable and attack humans often. They cause the
          highest per-capita human death rate of any bear species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adult sloth bears are missing their top two front teeth. This allows
          them to easily slurp down termites and other bugs like a vacuum. They
          do this while making loud, sucking sounds that can be heard from a
          distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sloth bear mothers are the only species of bear to carry their cubs on
          their backs. Apparently this is a common behavior in a lot of other
          animals that primarily eat ants/termites.

          The leopard seal is one of Antarctica's top predators. Their name
          comes from their black-spotted coat and predatory nature. Leopard
          seals are best known for preying on penguins, but they will also eat
          krill, fish, squid, seabirds, and other kinds of seals.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Leopard seals like to jam. They are known to spend hours every day
          underwater singing, while being upside down and rocking from side to
          side.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are ruthless when it comes to killing their prey. The seals sling
          penguins in an arc, snapping their neck and neck. They then smash them
          repeatedly against the surface of the water until they break open.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leopard seals are curious unafraid of humans. They've been known to
          lunge at ankles and on rare occasions have grabbed people and
          attempted to drag them underwater.

          Greenland shark (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>)
        </h2>

        </figure>
        <p>
          The greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate. Scientists
          currently estimate that they live anywhere from about 200-500 years.
          They primarily live in cold-water environments (-1.6&#8451; to
          12&#8451;) at depths down to several thousand meters below the
          surface. This is speculated to be the reason for their extremely long
          lifespans.
        </p>
        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Greenland sharks are slow at literally everything they do. They swim
          slowly at an average rate of 2.9 kilometers per hour. They grow slowly
          at a rate of about 1 cm a year, and don't reach sexual maturity until
          they're about 150 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their meat is toxic to humans when fresh and has a urine-like odor
          because of its high concentrations of urea. Despite this, the meat is
          considered an exotic delicacy in Nordic countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greenland sharks are scavengers and are attracted to the smell of both
          rotting meat and live prey. They mainly eat fish, squid, eels, other
          sharks, and seals. Parts of horses, reindeer, moose, and polar bears
          have also been found in their digestive systems. Since these sharks
          move so slowly, it's speculated that they have to ambush their prey in
          their sleep.

        <h2 id="squid">Humboldt squid (<i>Dosidicus gigas</i>)</h2>
        <figure>

        <p>
          The Humboldt squid is a large, predatory squid that lives in the
          eastern Pacific ocean. They are most commonly found at depths of 200
          to 700 meters below the surface. They can grow up to 2.5 meters long
          and have a lifespan of only 2 years. On each of the squid's tentacles,
          there are hundreds of barb-like hooked suckers. They use them to tear
          apart their prey and pull them towards their razor sharp beaks. Their
          diet mainly consists of fish, shrimp, and other cephalopods.
        </p>
        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
          They are nicknamed the "red devil." When under attack by fishermen or
          predators, the squid become absolutely fuming and turn a bright red
          color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humboldt squids can hunt alone or in groups of thousands. One of their
          hunting methods includes snatching their prey and pulling them deep
          unto the ocean until the victim falls unconcious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Humboldt squid has a tendency to meet unfamiliar objects
          aggressively. They've attacked deep-sea cameras and rendered them
          inoperable. There have been multiple accounts of the squid attacking
          fishermen and divers.
